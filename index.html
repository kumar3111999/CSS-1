    <h2 class="a4">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="a5">
      <ul>
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
          files. how ever,
          <mark>
            in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark
          >
          because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
          yourself.

    <div class="a6">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
      unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.
    </div><br>
    <div class="a7">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of
      styles can be applied to the elements.
    </div><br>
    <div class="a8">
      There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied.
